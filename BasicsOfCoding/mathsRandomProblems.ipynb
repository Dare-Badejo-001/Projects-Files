    "### Josephus Problem Description\n",

    "After the first person is executed, a certain number of people are skipped, and another person is executed. This process of\n",
    "execution continues around the circle until only one person remains. \n",
    "The individuals who have been executed are not included in the removal process, and the last person standing does not take their own life. \n",
    "The objective is to develop a function that, given values for n and k, returns the order in which the individuals will be executed.\n",
    "Here, n represents the total number of people, and k represents the number of skips. It is important to note that k can be smaller than, equal to, or even greater than n."
